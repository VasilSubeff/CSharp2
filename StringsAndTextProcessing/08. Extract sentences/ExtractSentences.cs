﻿//Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing given word.
//Example:
//The word is: in
//The text is: We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.
//The expected result is: We are living in a yellow submarine. We will move out of it in 5 days.
//Consider that the sentences are separated by . and the words – by non-letter symbols.
